## Thermal Expansion Analysis for Steel Shapes

## Overview

This project provides a practical application of automation for civil and structural engineers using [Selenium](selenium.dev). Focused on the concept of thermal expansion in structural materials, it combines web scraping and numerical analysis to show how temperature variations affect structural components.

## Features

### Example 1: Selenium IDE - Automated Download of AISC Shapes Database

- **Selenium IDE**: The test file for using the [Selenium IDE Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd) is included for Example 1 from the newsletter. This is for anyone interested in playing around with the record-macro features.

### Example 2: Web Scraping Climate Data for Thermal Expansion Calculations

- **Data Extraction with Selenium**: Utilizes Selenium, a powerful tool for web browser automation, to extract real-world climate data.
- **Thermal Expansion Calculation**: Employs fundamental engineering principles to calculate the thermal expansion of steel members based on temperature changes.
- **Visualization with Matplotlib**: Generates clear, informative plots to visualize the relationship between member length and thermal expansion.


## Application

The project is for civil and structural engineers, as well as students in these fields, providing hands-on experience in using automation to solve practical engineering problems.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **Selenium**: For automated web scraping of temperature data.
- **Matplotlib and NumPy**: For data processing and visualization.

## Getting Started

This project is beginner-friendly and is designed to be accessible for those new to Python or engineering applications. The Jupyter Notebook included in the repository walks you through each step of the process, from data extraction to thermal expansion analysis.
