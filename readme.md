# Thermal Expansion Analysis in Civil Engineering

## Overview

This project provides an insightful exploration into the world of civil engineering through a practical application of Python programming. Focused on the concept of thermal expansion in structural materials, it combines web scraping and numerical analysis to offer a comprehensive understanding of how temperature variations affect structural components.

## Features

- **Data Extraction with Selenium**: Utilizes Selenium, a powerful tool for web browser automation, to extract real-world climate data.
- **Thermal Expansion Calculation**: Employs fundamental engineering principles to calculate the thermal expansion of steel members based on temperature changes.
- **Visualization with Matplotlib**: Generates clear, informative plots to visualize the relationship between member length and thermal expansion.

## Application

The project is particularly valuable for civil and structural engineers, as well as students in these fields, providing a hands-on experience in applying Python to solve practical engineering problems. By automating data extraction and performing critical calculations, it demonstrates the integration of programming skills into traditional engineering practices.
